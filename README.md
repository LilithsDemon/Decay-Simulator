# Decay Simulator

This is a very simple decay simulator made in python
You give the program the amount of particles
It will then display a graph that shows how the decay pattern would occur (Decay is random)
This can then be used to show an exmaple of a half life and to see how even though something might get broken down randomly it seems natural with larger numbers
